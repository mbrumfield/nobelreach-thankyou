    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      This interview process has been a great experience, allowing me to meet the members from NobelReach and the City of OKC. These conversations enhanced my appreciation for the opportunity to contribute to public service through a tech-related role. In my initial interview with the program team, with Kate and Chelsea, I had the opportunity to share my passion for cybersecurity and gain insight into the program’s mission to drive innovation for the public good. My second conversation was with the City of OKC’s Chief Innovation Officer, Dr. Kelly Williams. She shared the city’s goals, the Bloomberg What Works Cities Certification, and the impactful work taking place across departments. Lastly, I spoke with the Vice President of Talent Programs, Rebeca Lamadrid, where I was able to express my interest in the program, learn more about the long-term vision, and discuss how my background and goals align with its mission.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a computer science and engineering education professional who takes an interdisciplinary approach. With four years of experience as a database administrator and applications administrator, two years as an assistant professor, and one year as a coordinator for a student-led cybersecurity clinic, the opportunity with the NobelReach Scholars Program and the City of Oklahoma City (OKC) aligns with my goal of utilizing and enhancing my skillset for public service. My long-term goal is to attain a leadership position in information technology.

    <h2>Key Alignments</h2>
    <h3><strong>Mission-Driven Impact:</strong></h3>
	<p>In my conversation with Kelly, she gave me insight about the need for someone to support the City of OKC’s effort in improving data governance across departments. The Office of Innovation currently consists of her efforts, where the city has achieved Silver status for the Bloomberg Philanthropies What Works Cities. I was amazed at the work that she is doing, and I see the correlation with the work that I contribute to provide risk assessments for community organizations and non-profits with the Cross-Sector Performance Goals (CPGs) provided by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). After reviewing the current work that the city is doing to improve emergency medical care, I am amazed and excited about looking at ways to enhance the data governance practices. This work will help support trauma patients and address homelessness challenges through evidence-based data strategies.</p>
	<h3><strong>Cross-Functional Leadership:</strong></h3>
	<p>I look forward to supporting Kelly and the Office of Innovation with making “stuff to work.” In this position, I look forward to working across city departments to identify opportunities for improvement in data governance practices and ensure alignment with the standards set by the Bloomberg What Works Cities initiative. My experience as an instructor has prepared me well for this kind of collaboration. For example, I have taught students with varying levels of expertise in computer programming, cybersecurity, and data science using tools like Excel and Python, which required adaptability and clear communication. Additionally, in my previous role as a database administrator, I regularly collaborated with business managers to define user access needs and ensure that data privileges and security protocols were appropriately assigned. This combination of technical expertise and cross-functional coordination equips me to support the City of OKC in fostering a data-informed culture across departments.</p>
	<h3><strong>Subject Matter Expertise:</strong></h3>
	<p>With a strong foundation in information technology and cybersecurity, including a Ph.D. in Engineering Education, a Master’s in Computer Science, and CISSP and Security+ certifications, I bring technical and analytical skills to this role. My academic and professional experience has prepared me to understand, assess, and implement data governance strategies across diverse organizational contexts. Leveraging established standards such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, I can help identify areas for improvement and promote consistent, secure practices across departments. Additionally, using the criteria outlined in the Bloomberg Philanthropies What Works Cities certification will support a structured approach to enhancing data practices and achieving measurable progress toward Gold status.</p>
	<h3><strong>Community Engagement:</strong></h3>
	<p>My community engagement efforts center on making cybersecurity, technology, and data literacy more accessible across age groups and learning levels. I currently help lead a cybersecurity clinic that provides pro bono risk assessments and awareness training for small businesses, nonprofits, and community organizations. Beyond that, I have delivered educational talks on artificial intelligence at a youth summit and presented on cybersecurity awareness at an adult day services conference. For four years, I also taught Python programming for an engineering-focused summer bridge program designed to support incoming first-year students and a high school public health and informatics program. These experiences reflect my commitment to outreach, equity, and lifelong learning in technology and data.</p>
	<h3><strong>Learning Agility:</strong></h3>
	<p>Kelly sparked my interest in working for the Office of Innovation because she is pursuing the PMP (Project Management Professional) certification. I commit to continuous learning and adaptability across technical and research domains. I pursued advanced topics in software engineering, cybersecurity, and AI/ML during my master’s program before pivoting to engineering education for my Ph.D., where I explored qualitative research methods and educational policy. In just six months, I earned the Security+, Certified in Cybersecurity (CC), and CISSP certifications, demonstrating my ability to quickly absorb and apply complex material. While serving as a database administrator, I was asked to contribute to both the database and web services teams due to my technical versatility and collaborative mindset. I plan to attain the CAPM this summer, pursue the PMP by 2026, and consider the CGRC certification to better support data governance and risk assessment responsibilities in this role.</p>
